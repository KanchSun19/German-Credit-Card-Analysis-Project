# German-Credit-Card-Analysis-Project

Credit risk scoring and assessment is very critical in the banking sector. In order to qualify to apply for loans, a loan applicant needs to be approved by a bank. The primary aim of this project is to choose and obtain the best model to aid in the prediction of creditability in the classification of a loan application. Creditability, the class attribute, is binary and comprises two categories. They are namely, “Good” or “Bad”. There are 20 attributes used in the credit risk assessment of a loan applicant.

This report conducts an analysis on German Credit Scoring and outlines the steps involved in determining if a loan applicant is qualified to apply for loans based on his or her creditability. Data analytics tools such as R, Weka and SAS were used to predict the creditability of a loan applicant.
